# IGTA Partner Program Overview

## What is the IGTA Partner Program?

The IGTA Partner Program is a referral partnership where individuals and organizations earn commissions by referring clients who need O-1 visa services. Partners can be anywhere in the world - we have active partners in Dubai, Ireland, UK, India, Nigeria, Brazil, and many other countries.

## Who is IGTA?

Innovative Global Talent Accelerator (IGTA) provides agent-based O-1 visa services for tech professionals. Led by Sherrod D. Seward, Esq., an experienced immigration litigator with 500+ successful visa cases, IGTA helps tech professionals escape the H-1B lottery and gain career freedom through the O-1 visa.

### Key IGTA Stats:
- 500+ successful visa cases
- 7+ years of experience
- 40+ countries served
- $275K average alumni salary
- Notable clients include world boxing champions and UFC athletes

## How the Partner Program Works

### Step 1: Refer a Client
Partners identify tech professionals, entrepreneurs, or companies in their network who need O-1 visa services. This could be:
- Software engineers on H-1B facing layoffs
- International founders wanting to work in the US
- AI/ML researchers seeking career flexibility
- Tech professionals tired of the H-1B lottery

### Step 2: IGTA Handles Everything
Once a referral is made, IGTA takes over completely:
- Client qualification using AI assessment (aivisaevaluation.com)
- Evidence building (publications, speaking, awards)
- Legal petition preparation
- Attorney coordination
- USCIS filing and follow-up

### Step 3: Partner Earns Commission
Partners receive their commission when the client enrolls in a program. No ongoing management required.

## Partner Requirements

To become an IGTA partner, you should have:
- Access to tech professionals or entrepreneurs who might need O-1 visas
- Professional reputation in your industry or region
- Willingness to learn about IGTA's programs
- Ethical commitment to quality referrals

No legal or immigration expertise is required - IGTA handles all of that.

## What Partners Do NOT Need to Do

- No legal knowledge required
- No client management required
- No follow-up with USCIS
- No handling of paperwork
- No ongoing support obligations

## The Deal Memo System

Partners can optionally provide "deal memos" - interest letters that help strengthen O-1 applications:

### What is a Deal Memo?
A deal memo is a letter expressing interest in engaging a candidate for potential contract work. It shows USCIS that legitimate work opportunities exist for the visa applicant.

### Key Points:
- No actual work commitment required
- Rate just needs to be above minimum wage (typically $75-150/hour)
- Starts from visa approval
- Can be used for multiple candidates
- Creates "agent petition" eligibility

### Benefits to Partners Providing Deal Memos:
- First look at top-tier pre-vetted tech talent
- No employment obligation or liability
- Position as supporter of global talent
- Potential future engagement with top candidates
