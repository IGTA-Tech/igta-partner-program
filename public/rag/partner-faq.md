## Referral Process Questions

## Deal Memo Questions

### Q: What is a deal memo?
**A:** A deal memo is an interest letter from a company expressing potential interest in engaging a candidate. It helps strengthen O-1 applications by showing legitimate work opportunities exist.

### Q: Does a deal memo mean I have to hire someone?

### Q: What should the hourly rate be on a deal memo?
**A:** Typically $75-150/hour. The rate just needs to be reasonable for professional services.

## O-1 Visa Questions

### Q: What is the O-1 visa?
**A:** The O-1 visa is for individuals with extraordinary ability in their field. Unlike H-1B, it's merit-based (no lottery), allows multiple employers, and enables business ownership.

### Q: How is O-1 better than H-1B?
**A:** Key differences:
- No lottery (merit-based)
- Work for multiple employers simultaneously
- Start your own business while on the visa
- No salary minimums
- Unlimited renewals
- Not tied to a single employer

### Q: What does "agent-based O-1" mean?
**A:** Instead of having a single employer sponsor the visa, an "agent" files the petition. This allows the visa holder to work for multiple clients/employers with flexibility.

### Q: What are the 8 O-1 criteria?
**A:** Applicants must meet 3 of 8 criteria:
1. Awards/prizes for excellence
2. Membership in elite associations
3. Published material about the person
4. Judging others' work
5. Original contributions of significance
6. Scholarly articles/publications
7. Employment in critical capacity
8. High salary/remuneration
